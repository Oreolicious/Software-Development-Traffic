# Software-Development-Traffic

This project was made for a school assignment. It contains both the simulation and controller for a traffic stop. The assignment required both the simulator and controller to be interchangeable with simulators and controllers from other students.

## Using the controller

Download the most recent version of the master branch. A ready built .exe version of our program can be found at the following location:

* **Software-Development-Traffic/Traffic Controller/x64/Release/**

> Note that the .exe requires the folder "Layouts" with a file called "main.rl". This file contains the road layout so the controller can figure out which lights to turn on and off.

*In case you're confused about how to run the controller, watch the following [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).*

## Using the simulator
**Work in progress**
